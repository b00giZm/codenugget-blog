Writing and maintaining a blog - especially one, where you commited to write articles in a language other than your native one - can be hard and cumbersome. I know that, because I tried several times. It's time consuming and most of the proprietery blogging engines out there are crap. While I really enjoy the writing itself, I definitely didn't enjoy using almost all mainstream blogging software out there. And those who offered some refreshing new ideas to web publishing (like [Postach.io](http://postach.io)[^postach]), I found pretty much limited when it came to customization.

But I wanted to give this whole thing another try. So, I asked myself: What would you consider to be the "perfect" and sustainable setup for your personal blogging needs? Here's what I came up with:

* __Let me have my own workflow__ — I don't want to use a slow and poorly written web interface or mobile app. I want to use the same tools I use every day to get my work done.
* __Let me choose where to write__ — I'm still most productive in front of my Mac, but I also want to be able to prepare postings and capture thoughts on the go from my iPhone or iPad in a maximal convenient way (i.e. without keeping duplicate notes and/or emailing stuff to myself).
* __Let me have the design \*I\* love__ — I don't want no fancy $50 template with annoying parallax scrolling effects and other weird distrations. I just want a simple, clean and responsive design, eye-pleasing choices of colors and some nice looking fonts[^objc].
* __Let me have full control over my content__ — I'm a developer and I love getting my hands dirty (okay, not *that* kind of "Wordpress-dirty") . I don't want search the swamps of horrible blogging engine plugins to get some kind of half-assed solution for something I could've done myself much better in a few hours. I also want control over where to publish and host my own content.

And here we are. You, me and this shiny new blog. So yeah, I did some things differently this time. I can't say if my new setup is *the* perfect one, and it's still far from being considered as completed. Also, neither of the tools and workflows I use are new or unique. But so far I think the combination of all satisfies my needs pretty nicely as author, as well as developer.

So join me next when, when I'll talk albout my new setup and everything else in much more detail.

[^postach]: Since I "live" almost entirely in [Evernote](https://evernote.com), I was really excited about its promise to generate static sites out of my notes. But still being not able to use Markdown inside Evernote is a pretty big deal breaker for me.

[^objc]: I'm A big fan of the [objc](http://www.objc.io) publications. Besides having always awesome and high quality content, they just nail it with the design. So yeah, you might call them a big inspriation for me.
