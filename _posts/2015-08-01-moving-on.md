After a little more than 9 years in my current job, working for a full stack service agency managing, developing and maintaining web products of all different kinds, I decided it's time for me to make the next step, so I'll be moving on. Today, I'm proud to announce that, starting September 2015, I'll be a part of the awesome team at [pixelhouse GmbH](http://pixelhouse.de), taking a senior engineering position in their backend team.

If you're from Germany or other parts of Europe but don't know about pixelhouse, chances are you might know their product, which is [Chefkoch.de](http://chefkoch.de). Chefkoch.de is Europe's biggest site about cooking, which just recently entered the [IWC](http://www.ivw.eu) top 10 of Germany's most visited websites with some profound numbers 49m monthly vistors and the corresponding 274m monthly page impressions, [measured in december 2014](http://ausweisung.ivw-online.de/index.php?i=1161&a=o14730).

I honestly couldn't be more excited. Besides from the fact that cooking truly is one of my favorite hobbies and passions, I'm really looking forward to the challenges of developing and operating such a popular and high frequented web and mobile platform that already brought so many "collective moments of joy" to such a big number of people.

The backend teams at pixelhouse mostly use PHP for developing their applications. Some of you now might ask what the hell drove my decission to accept another PHP gig, so let's get this out of the way: First of all, pixelhouse uses a modern stack of frameworks and libraries as their toolchain, inlcuding the [Symfony framework](http://symfony.com) and its [components](http://symfony.com/components). Secondly, they deeply care about code quality and fully embrace the idea of agile development, test automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. The entire team is split up into smaller Scrum teams, each with one dedicated QA engineer. And, speaking of dedication, two members of my future team mates, which I already came to know, formally worked at the "mother ship", [SensioLabs Germany](http://www.sensiolabs.de). You know, I really thrive when I work with and am surrounded by smart and highly motivated people. That's why I love the open source community. And with this gig at pixelhouse, I think it'll take this to a whole new level.

Lastly — and that's so important that I dedicate a whole paragraph to it — after all these years, I still like PHP, even if I (and many others) have cursed about it about a million times. I'm good at it, and I know how to get things done in a reasonable amount of time, while satisfying my own quality standards. Also, I think that, overall, PHP is moving in a very good direction, not least because of its awesome community. Sounds like [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome "Stockholm syndrome - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"), you say? Well, I'm in this business long enough to know that there will always be a newer or (subjectively) cooler language or technology, and that's totally okay. I'm a strong proponent of the "right tool for the right job" principle. We live in exciting times, where, thanks to [micro services architectures](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) and ["containerization"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), it's easier than ever to create heterogeneous environments, which let you focus on pragmatism and productivity, instead of "religious" wars about the one and only "true" programming language and/or technology.

Let me close with a quote from Steve Jobs' famous [commencement address at the Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc):

> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.

The last 9 years have been an amazing rollercoaster ride. I'd like to thank all my friends and former teammates for the time we spent together and giving me the freedom to let me evolve into the person I am today. I'm sad to leave all this behind, but, on the other hand, so excited for all things that are now ahead of me. Thank you for understanding and supporting me with this anything else but easy decision.

(To be continued...)
